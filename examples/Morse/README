This is a simple example input files for parameterizing a set of displaced Morse oscillators

Ground state parameters are contained in the params_gs.dat file. Each row corresponds to an
independent Morse oscillator. The first value is the well depth D in Ha. The second value is
the width alpha in Bohr. The third value is the reduced mass mu in atomic units. It is assumed
to be identical in the ground and excited state Morse oscillator. Finally, in the 4th column,
there is an optional parameter lambda. This parameter is the couplin of the dipole moment to 
nuclear degrees of freedom (non-Condon effects). In this model, it is assumed that the transition
dipole moment fluctuations around the mean are proportional to the effective classical energy gap 
between S0 and S1, with lambda being the proportionality constant.

Excited state parameters are contained in the params_ex.dat file. Again each row corresponds to
an independent morse oscillator. The first two values are again D and alpha respectively. The 
third value is the shift in bohr of the excited state minimum with respect to the ground state
minimum.
